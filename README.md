# BoomBikes Sharing/ Linear Regression Assignment
An Assignment on Multiple Linear Regression Using RFE and MinMax Scaling

## Introduction

In order to anticipate the demand for shared bikes, you must construct a multiple linear regression model for this programming project. For the same, a Jupyter notebook must be submitted. 


## Problem Statement
A bike-sharing system is a service that allows people to check out bikes for free or at a cost for short-term shared use. Numerous bike share programs enable users to check out bikes from "docks," which are often computerized locations where users input payment details and the system unlocks the bike. After that, you can return this bike to any other dock in the system.

The ongoing Corona outbreak has caused significant drops in revenue for US bike-sharing company BoomBikes. The current state of the market is making it extremely difficult for the organization to survive. It has therefore made the conscious decision to develop a thoughtful business plan in order to boost its income as soon as the current lockdown ends and the economy recovers to a sound state. 

BoomBikes is making an effort to comprehend the need for shared bikes among the populace once the country's current Covid-19-related quarantine ends. They have planned this in order to position themselves to differentiate themselves from other service providers, make significant profits, and be ready to meet people's needs when things improve overall.

To ascertain the variables influencing the demand for these shared bikes, they have hired a consultancy firm. Their specific goal is to comprehend the variables that influence the demand in the US market for these shared bikes. The business is curious about:

- Which factors are important for forecasting the need for shared bicycles.
- How well those factors capture the needs of the bike

The service provider company has amassed a sizable dataset on daily bike demands across the American market based on a number of elements, including people's styles and numerous climatic assessments. 

### Goal:
You must use the available independent variables to model the demand for shared bikes. The management will use it to comprehend how precisely requests fluctuate with various aspects. In order to satisfy the demands of the customers and the levels of demand, they can adjust their business strategy accordingly. Furthermore, management will find the model useful in comprehending the dynamics of demand in a new market.
